ir-blower
=========

IR-Blower consists of three parts.

1) A GTK2 desktop client (written in Ruby/GTK) [Systray app + GUI window]

2) A Server (written in Ruby)

3) A hardware control (Written for Arduino)


The concept for the IR-Blower project is simple.

Control a remote device via its inbuilt IR sensor from a desktop app running on a PC.
Must be able to work in a Client/Server mode across local LAN's.

This is still very much a work in progress.
